# Data Visualization Project

## Data

The data I propose to visualize for my project is 'Global Data: GDP, Life Expectancy & More'
link to the dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arslaan5/global-data-gdp-life-expectancy-and-more



## Questions & Tasks

The following tasks and questions will drive the visualization and interaction decisions for this project:

 * Is the GDP per capita impacting the life expectancy? How are they behaving when related?
 * What are the regions with high CO2 emissions, Which countries in the particular region are contributing the most?
 * What is the distribution of GDP contribution by region and country?
 * What is the average life expectancy of different regions and what is the gender-wise contribution to it?

## Sketches

Effect of GDP per capital on Life expectancy: This sketch is an idea to check how life expectancy is behaving with increasing GDP percapita

CO2 Emission by region and country: This sketch is an idea of visualizing the CO2 emmisions using a sunburst chart

GDP Contribution by region and country: This sketch is an idea of the contribution of different regions and countries to GDP. A dropdown can be added to check contributions to different variables such as Population, GDP growth, Unemployment, Life expectancy, CO2 emissions, etc.

## Prototypes

I’ve created a proof of concept visualization for my first sketch: Relationship between GDP per capita and Life Expectancy

(please put a screenshot of one or more visualizations of this dataset you already made, for previous assignments, and link to them)

You can put images into here by pasting them into issues.

You can make images into links like this:

Also, you can study the [source](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/curran/dataviz-project-template-proposal/master/README.md) to figure out Markdown formatting. You can use the GitHub built-in editor to edit the document.

## Open Questions

(describe any fear, uncertainty, or doubt you’re having about the feasibility of implementing the sketched system. For example, “I’m not sure where to get the geographic shapes to build a map from this data” or “I don’t know how to resolve the codes to meaningful names” … Feel free to delete this section if you’re confident.)

## Milestones

(for each week, estimate what would be accomplised)
