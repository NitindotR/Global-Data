# Data Visualization Project

## Data

The data I propose to visualize for my project is 'Global Data: GDP, Life Expectancy & More'
link to the dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arslaan5/global-data-gdp-life-expectancy-and-more



## Questions & Tasks

The following tasks and questions will drive the visualization and interaction decisions for this project:

 * Is the GDP per capita impacting the life expectancy? How are they behaving when related?
 * What are the regions with high CO2 emissions, Which countries in the particular region are contributing the most?
 * What is the distribution of GDP contribution by region and country?
 * What is the average life expectancy of different regions and what is the gender-wise contribution to it?

## Sketches

Effect of GDP per capital on Life expectancy: This sketch is an idea to check how life expectancy is behaving with increasing GDP percapita

CO2 Emission by region and country: This sketch is an idea of visualizing the CO2 emmisions using a sunburst chart

GDP Contribution by region and country: This sketch is an idea of the contribution of different regions and countries to GDP. A dropdown can be added to check contributions to different variables such as Population, GDP growth, Unemployment, Life expectancy, CO2 emissions, etc.

## Prototypes

Iâ€™ve created a proof of concept visualization for my first sketch: Relationship between GDP per capita and Life Expectancy

## Open Questions

I am new to learning D3 and I am not sure how heavy the workload is for the visualizations I am aiming. I am taking this challenge and working on it.

## Milestones

  - By the end of this week, I would start working on the sunburst chart.
  - Finish the sunburst chart by next week and start learning to create a treemap.
